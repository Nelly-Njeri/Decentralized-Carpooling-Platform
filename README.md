## Introduction

The Decentralized Carpooling System aims to provide a secure and decentralized platform for users to connect with each other for carpooling purposes. By utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts, we aim to enhance transparency, reduce dependency on intermediaries, and foster a community-driven approach to carpooling.

## Features

- **Decentralization:** The system operates on a decentralized network, reducing reliance on a central authority.
- **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts facilitate secure and automated transactions between users.
- **Privacy:** User data is encrypted and stored securely, respecting the privacy of individuals.
- **Community-driven:** Users can contribute to the platform's development and improvement.
